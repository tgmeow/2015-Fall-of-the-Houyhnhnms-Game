# 2015-Fall-of-the-Houyhnhnms-Game
This is the final game for my Game Theory/Design class at SCGSSM.

A great amount of time was spend creating this game. This is a Java project that was initally run in the Processing software, but was then exported to Eclipse for greater control over variables and methods. This project uses the Processing libraries.
